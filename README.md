# BoozeshotRoulette
Basically a simplified version of Buckshot roulette but as a game on phones.

Originally set out to be a drinking game but having to pivot bc GPlay and AppStore are buzzkills. Hoping the Buckshot Roulette idea doesnt have a copyright or anything and I can just make another version and put it out on ios and android. 

My mods that I'm trying to do.
- Freeroam mode, just endless shooty shooty with 6 shots in a barrel.
- 1v1 with a person, 5 lives, 2 items per iter
-
